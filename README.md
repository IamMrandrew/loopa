# Loopa
Loopa is my first web app using [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and the popular framework [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js/). As the name implies, LOOPA is a LOOPER! This course project is in collaboration with @WadeHo

## Features
- Unlimited Loopers
- Effects and filters for each loopers

## How the loops works
### Tone.Transport
I used the Transport timing clock provided by Tone.js as the fundamental timing of my loopstation.

## Recorder.js
